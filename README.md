# Tutorial
 <p>First, download and install Git and Webstorm. Second, go to the official websites of Github and Webstorm to register 
  an account. After that, open Webstorm and press (Ctrl+Alt+S) for system preferences. Select Version control and enter 
  the path to the git.exe. "If Git is installed correctly, you should get the message 'Git Executed Successfully.' The 
  version number is displayed" (ExtraInstallationInstructions). Next, creat new project on the Webstorm main page and 
  creat the file type that you want. We use html 5 in this case.When you finish to editing the file, we should commit 
  the changes to GIT by clicking commit file. Finally, we should add the file to GitHub. Click VCS -> Import into 
  Version Control -> Share Project on Github.If all goes well you will receive a message “Successfully shared project 
  on GitHub.”<p>



**<p>Branch**:A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. <p>
**<p>Clone**:A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy <p>
**<p>Commit**: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). <p>
**<p>Fetch**:Adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. <p>
**<p>GIT**: Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of. <p>
**<p>Github**: A GitHub site where employers can post jobs that GitHub users may be interested in.<p>
**<p>Merge**: Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.  <p>
**<p>Merge Conflict**: Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. <p>
**<p>Push**: Push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. <p>
**<p>Pull**:Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them <p>
**<p>Remote**:This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced. <p>
**<p>Repository**: A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. <p>
